Ada layer for Yocto
-------------------

This adds support for building Ada programs under Yocto. This is a work in
progress and more Ada libs will be added in future.

The main branch is for Denzil and GCC 4.6.

To build, you need a GCC that understands Ada, this causes problems for some
systems, i.e. on my Debian testing 64-bit, where the main compiler does not
understand Ada and the Ada compiler has it's own gcc/g++. I was not able to
force Yocto to build using gcc-4.6 and g++-4.6. I had to hack it by compiling
my own GCC-4.6.3 toolchain and fixing the multiarch problems with soft links
to crt[i1n].o and lib[cm].[a|so]. Any hints getting this to work would be
greatly appreciated.

** This build will not build shared libs under Yocto/Poky

See recipes-test/libhello to see how to build a library under Yocto, and see
recipes-test/hello so see how to use it under Yocto.

Debian / Ubuntu
---------------

Before building you need gnat, but as these packages are separate from the
stock gcc and also a different version, you have to make sure Yocto will
use the correct compilers. I create a new directory with links and then
export those in my path:

sudo mkdir -p /opt/gnat-4.6-links/bin
sudo cd /opt/gnat-4.6-links/bin
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.6 gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-4.6 g++
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/cpp-4.6 cpp

export PATH=/opt/gnat-4.6-links/bin:${PATH}

N.B: Do not export a link to ld but using gcc-4.6 as this will fail to build
due to specific ld flags being passed into gcc which it won't understand.

Add the following the build/conf/local.conf
-------------------------------------------

# These do not build yet.
BBMASK = "gprbuild|xmlada"

# Delete the work directories after a successful build.
INHERIT = "rm_work"

# Can delete this once you have a working Yocto.
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " hello"

# Add to the following variable to make the Ada projects available to gnatmake:
GPR_PROJECT_PATH = "${STAGING_LIBDIR}/ada/libhello"
#GPR_PROJECT_PATH .= ":${STAGING_LIBDIR}/ada/<project name>"
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH
